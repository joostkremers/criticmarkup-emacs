;; CriticMarkup for Emacs
;; ======================
;;
;; `cm-mode' is a minor mode that provides support for CriticMarkup in Emacs.
;;
;; CriticMarkup is a way for authors and editors to track changes to
;; documents in plain text.  It defines the following patterns for marking
;; changes:
;;
;; - Addition {++ ++}
;; - Deletion {-- --}
;; - Substitution {~~ ~> ~~}
;; - Comment {>> <<}
;; - Highlight {== ==}{>> <<}
;;
;; `cm-mode' provides the following functionality:
;;
;; - font lock support
;; - key bindings to insert CriticMarkup.
;; - 'follow changes' mode: automatically record changes to the buffer.
;; - accept/reject changes interactively.
;; - automatically add author tag.
;; - navigation to move between changes.
;;
;;
;; Key bindings
;; ------------
;;
;; `cm-mode' provides the following key bindings:
;;
;; `C-c * a' : add text
;; `C-c * d' : delete text
;; `C-c * s' : make a substitution
;; `C-c * c' : add a comment
;; `C-c * i' : accept/reject change at point
;; `C-c * I' : accept/reject all changes interactively
;; `C-c * *' : move forward out of a change
;; `C-c * f' : move forward to the next change
;; `C-c * b' : move backward to the previous change
;; `C-c * t' : set author
;; `C-c * F' : activate follow changes mode
;;
;; The `C-c *' prefix can easily be changed, if so desired:
;;
;; (define-key cm-mode-map (kbd "C-c *") nil)
;; (define-key cm-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'cm-prefix-map)
;;
;; This unbinds `C-c *' and sets up `C-c c' as the prefix for all cm-mode
;; commands.
;;
;; Usage
;; -----
;;
;; See README.md for details.
